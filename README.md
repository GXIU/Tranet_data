### Trains_UK_dataset.zip

This dataset contains information about the routes operated by 41 different railway companies over 2944 stations across the UK.
Nodes represent railway stations, while a link exists between two nodes only if there is at least one service between them. Layers represent the different railway companies operating in the UK. 
The dataset is obtained from OpenTrainTimes (http://www.opentraintimes.com/)

### Coaches_UK_dataset.zip
This dataset contains information about 17433 routes between 12767 locations operated by 1219 different regional operators. In this case, nodes represent coach stations or stops, while a link exists between two nodes only if there is at least one
connection between them. Layers represent the different regional service providers.
The dataset is obtained from the Traveline Open Data (http://www.travelinedata.org.uk/) which also contains data from the National Coach Services Database (NCSD).
